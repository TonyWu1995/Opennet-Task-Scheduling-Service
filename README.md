# üì¨ Task Scheduling Service ‚Äì Backend Homework

This is a technical assignment for backend engineer candidates. You are expected to build a RESTful schedule-task service using **Spring Boot**, integrating **MySQL**, **Redis**, and **RocketMQ**.


---

## üéØ Objective

Build a RESTful Task Scheduling API that lets users create a task with a specific future execution time.
The system must:
- Store scheduled tasks
- Publish task trigger messages at the specified time
- Allow querying and managing scheduled tasks
- Utilize Redis or in-memory queue as delay buffer (if desired)
- Integrate with RocketMQ for downstream processing

---

## üß∞ Tech Requirements

You **must use** the following technologies:

- **Java 21+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **MySQL** (for persistence)
- **Redis** (for caching)
- **RocketMQ** (for event messaging)

You may use starter dependencies such as:
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Cache
- RocketMQ Spring Boot Starter

---

## üîß Features to Implement

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Scheduled Task

**Endpoint:** `POST /tasks`

```json
{
  "taskId": "abc-123",
  "executeAt": "2025-07-21T15:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "type": "email",
    "target": "hello@example.com",
    "message": "This is a scheduled task!"
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Store the task record in MySQL
- Optionally insert into a Redis delay queue or sorted set
- Ensure the task will be published to RocketMQ (`task-schedule-topic`) when `executeAt` is reached

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Poll & Trigger Task Execution

**Mechanism:**
- A background service should check for due tasks (`executeAt <= now()`)
- Once due, publish the `payload` to MQ
- Mark the task as `triggered` in MySQL

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get Task by ID

**Endpoint:** `GET /tasks/{taskId}`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Return task details including status, payload, and scheduled time

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Cancel Scheduled Task

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /tasks/{taskId}`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Mark the task as `cancelled` in DB
- Prevent MQ publishing if it hasn‚Äôt been triggered

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ List Pending Tasks

**Endpoint:** `GET /tasks?status=pending`

**Expected Behavior:**
- Return future scheduled tasks with pagination

‚∏ª

üß™ Bonus (Optional)
- Use Spring Cache abstraction or RedisTemplate encapsulation
- Apply proper error handling with meaningful status codes
- Define your own DTO and message format for RocketMQ
- Use consistent and modular code structure (controller, service, repository, config, etc.)
- Test case coverage: as much as possible

‚∏ª

üê≥ Environment Setup

Use the provided docker-compose.yaml file to start required services:

Service	Port  
MySQL	3306  
Redis	6379  
RocketMQ Namesrv	9876  
RocketMQ Broker	10911  
RocketMQ Console	8088  

To start the services:

```commandline
docker-compose up -d
```

MySQL credentials:
- User: taskuser
- Password: taskpass
- Database: taskdb

You may edit init.sql to create required tables automatically.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Getting Started

To run the application:

./mvn spring-boot:run

Make sure to update your application.yml with the proper connections for:
- spring.datasource.url
- spring.redis.host
- rocketmq.name-server

‚∏ª

üì§ Submission

Please submit a `public Github repository` that includes:
- ‚úÖ Complete and executable source code
- ‚úÖ README.md (this file)
- ‚úÖ Any necessary setup or data scripts please add them in HELP.md
- ‚úÖ Optional: Postman collection or curl samples  

‚∏ª

üìå Notes
- Focus on API correctness, basic error handling, and proper use of each technology
- You may use tools like Vibe Coding / ChatGPT to assist, but please write and understand your own code
- The expected time to complete is around 3 hours

Good luck!
